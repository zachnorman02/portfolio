            <h1>Zach Norman</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Zach. I am graduating in May 2023 with my Bachelor's in Computer Science and 
                Math from Northeastern University, and will be starting shortly after as an Application
                Engineer at Vanguard. I am interested in software development, data science, and web development.
                Through previous projects and work experience, I have lots of development experience across
                a wide range of languages and technologies. I am also in the process of applying to Master's degree
                programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                This site is a work-in-progress in terms of aesthetics, however the vast majority of
                the site is complete, with the exception of this home page, where I want to add more information
                later. I am also in the process of adding a blog. It is linked in the navbar, though it
                is currently empty.
            </p>
            <p>
