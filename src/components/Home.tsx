      <p>
        Hi, I'm Zach. I am graduating in May 2023 with my Bachelor's in Computer
        Science and Math from Northeastern University, and will be starting
        shortly after as an Application Engineer at Vanguard. I am interested in
        software development, data science, and web development. Through
        previous projects and work experience, I have lots of development
        experience across a wide range of languages and technologies. I am also
        in the process of applying to Master's degree programs.
      </p>

        This site is a work-in-progress in terms of aesthetics, however the vast
        majority of the site is complete, with the exception of this home page,
        where I want to add more information later. I am also in the process of
        adding a blog. It is linked in the navbar, though it is currently empty.
