        Hi, I'm Zach. I just graduated in April 2023 with my Bachelor's in
        Computer Science and Math from Northeastern University, and will be
        starting shortly after as an Application Engineer at Vanguard. I am
        interested in software development, data science, and web development.
        Through previous projects and work experience, I have lots of
        development experience across a wide range of languages and
        technologies. I am also in the process of applying to Master's degree
        programs.

        This site is a work-in-progress in terms of aesthetics, however the vast
        majority of the site is complete, with the exception of this home page,
        where I want to add more information later.
